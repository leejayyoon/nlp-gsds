## Course description

This course introduces core deep learning techniques used in modern natural language processing and visits recent advances and the challenges unresolved.

This course covers the following topics:

- How NLP utilizes representation learning.
- How problems in NLP motivated novel deep learning approaches such as attention and self-attention.
- Architectures: RNN, Sequence-to-sequence model, Transformer.
- Applications: word embedding, Language Model, core NLP (Parsing, SRL), QA and natural language generation (Summarization, Machine Translation, etc.) problems.
- Recent concerns: controllability, injection of constraints and knowledge, bias & fairness

## Grading policy

- **Final grade** will be determined as a weighted average of the assignments, midterm, and project.
    - Cutoffs for final grades will be approximately 97+ A+, 93+ A, 90+ A-, 87+ B+, 83+ B, 80+ B-, etc.
- **Assignments**: 70%  A+ (100), A (96), A- (92), B+ (88), B (85), B- (82), or below.
    - There will be four assignments.
- **Midterm**: *20%*
- **Project (optional):** Assignment 3 & 4 can be replaced with project.
    - Project proposal & state-of-the-art reimplementation (Due date identical to Assignment 3 due)
    - Final report & presentation.
    - Teams of 2-3. Individual project requires permission from instructor.
    - Project grading
        - A+: Exceptional or surprising. Goes far beyond most other submissions.
        - A: A survey that covers all the major relevant papers in the field and a well-grounded project proposal based on this survey.
        - A-: The survey has a good analysis but is missing a few pieces of relevant related work, or is quite complete but is lacking in critical analysis or forward directions.
        - B+: The survey is either quite lacking in coverage or analysis, or is decent but not complete in both aspects.
        - B or B-: The survey is lacking in both coverage and analysis, but does make an attempt to cover some related research.
        - C+ or below: Clear lack of effort or incompleteness.
