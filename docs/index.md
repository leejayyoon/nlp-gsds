## Course description

This course introduces core deep learning techniques used in modern natural language processing and visits recent advances and the challenges unresolved.

This course covers the following topics:

- How NLP utilizes representation learning.
- How problems in NLP motivated novel deep learning approaches such as attention and self-attention.
- Architectures: RNN, Sequence-to-sequence model, Transformer.
- Applications: word embedding, Language Model, core NLP (Parsing, SRL), QA and natural language generation (Summarization, Machine Translation, etc.) problems.
- Recent concerns: controllability, injection of constraints and knowledge, bias & fairness

## Grading policy
- Up to 10 **grace days** are provided (maximum 3 days per assignment). Using grace days for final project report is not allowed.
- **Final grade** will be determined as a weighted average of the assignments, midterm, and project.
    - Cutoffs for final grades will be approximately 97+ A+, 93+ A, 90+ A-, 87+ B+, 83+ B, 80+ B-, etc.
- **Assignments**: 35%  A+ (100), A (96), A- (92), B+ (88), B (85), B- (82), or below.
    - There will be TWO assignments.
        -  [Assigment 1](https://github.com/yc-song/gsds-nlp-assignment-1)
        -  Assigment 2 (To be released soon)
- **Participation**: 5%
- **Quiz**: 10%
- **Paper presentation**: 10%
- **Project** : 40%
   - Teams of 2-3. Individual project requires permission from instructor.
   - Idea proposal (1 page description of proposed idea). The idea proposal should include following:
       - Description of task.
       - Description of challenges to resolve, or project goal that the project wants to achieve.
       - Small survey of existing approaches (and their limitations) in short.
   - Project proposal (3 pages) should include the following
       - Baseline establishment: running the state-of-the-art models & analyzing it.
       - More extensive literature survey compared to idea proposal.
   - Final report & presentation.  (about 6 pages)

   - Project grading
        - A+: Exceptional or surprising. Goes far beyond most other submissions.
        - A: A survey that covers all the major relevant papers in the field and a well-grounded project proposal based on this survey.
        - A-: The survey has a good analysis but is missing a few pieces of relevant related work, or is quite complete but is lacking in critical analysis or forward directions.
        - B+: The survey is either quite lacking in coverage or analysis, or is decent but not complete in both aspects.
        - B or B-: The survey is lacking in both coverage and analysis, but does make an attempt to cover some related research.
        - C+ or below: Clear lack of effort or incompleteness.
   - Example tasks
